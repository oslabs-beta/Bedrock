# Bedrock

A fully modular authentication library for Deno that intends to be the * *Bedrock* * of your application's authentication/session control. Bedrock provides authentication (Local + MFA, OAuth), and session handling middleware as well as conditional access controls to restrict access to your routes as defined by your application's requirements.

# Features

Bedrock provides various authentication strategies for the developer to build out a secure application with minimal developmental effort by abstracting the authentication and session management process while giving the developer full control of which parts they want to use.

# v1.0.0

Initial release supporting the following authentication strategies:
- Local Authentication, with optional MFA options
  - TOTP code (generated by popular apps such as Google and Microsoft Authenticator)
  - SMS code (Via Authy)

  - Google

Built on top of the [Oak](https://github.com/oakserver/oak) library and intended to be used as middleware in routes.

Session management handled by [oak_sessions](https://github.com/jcs224/oak_sessions)
