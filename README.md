# Bedrock

A fully modular authentication library for Deno that intends to be the * *Bedrock* * of your application's authentication/session control. Bedrock provides authentication (Local + MFA, OAuth), and session handling middleware as well as conditional access controls to restrict access to your routes as defined by your application's requirements.
