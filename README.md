A fully modular authentication library for Deno that intends to be the * *Bedrock* * of your application's authentication/session control. Bedrock provides authentication (Local + MFA, OAuth), and session handling middleware as well as conditional access controls to restrict access to your routes as defined by your application's requirements.

## Features

Bedrock provides various authentication strategies for the developer to build out a secure application with minimal developmental effort by abstracting the authentication and session management process while giving the developer full control of which parts they want to use.
